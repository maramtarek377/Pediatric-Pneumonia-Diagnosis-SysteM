# Pediatric-Pneumonia-Diagnosis-SysteM
	A lung infection causing inflammation in the air sacs, leading to symptoms like fever,
cough, and shortness of breath. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi and is particularly dangerous for vulnerable groups.

	Early detection through chest X-rays is crucial for effective treatment and preventing complications.
# Data Used 
	Capturing high-quality pediatric chest X-rays is challenging due to children's discomfort and different physiology. Most datasets focus on adults, highlighting the need for pediatric-specific X-ray classification models.

	5,856 Chest X-rays labelled as either pneumonia or normal.

# 	Function of system
	The Pneumonia Diagnosis System leverages deep learning, specifically
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a rule-based expert system to 
diagnose pneumonia from chest X-ray images and refine the diagnosis using 
pediatric data. 

	This hybrid system enhances diagnostic accuracy by combining image analysis 
with pediatric -specific information, offering a more comprehensive assessment
of the pediatric condition.
